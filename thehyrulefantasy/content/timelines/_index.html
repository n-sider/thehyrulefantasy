title: The Timeline
---

<p>I think this is just gonna show the most recent timeline partial, then link off to the other game pages to see other versions of it.</p>

<p>OR NOT, this may need to have a "view as of this event" switcher, each going to a dedicated URL.  Particularly so I have a no-js fallback for when you choose to "expand" a timeline on an event page.</p>
