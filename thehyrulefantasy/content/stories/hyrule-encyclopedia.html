<p>According to Encyclopedia, Oracle of Seasons takes place after A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening and before Oracle of Ages. The Japanese Encyclopedia notes that they feature a different Link from the prior games, while the English localization refers to all four games as featuring the same Link.</p>

<p>so basically this book changes the orders of those games, and is the only item in this whole site that actually retcons a Link's identity.  Though you could argue it's a retcon of a retcon, if you don't like that Hyrule Historia implied the Oracles happened with LTTP link.</p>
